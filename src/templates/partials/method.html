            <p><b>1.</b> Data collected are for the candidates confirmed in office. Candidates and races were confirmed using the AP Elections API. Demographic data was confirmed via a list of online sources listed below. </p>
            <p><b>2.</b> Congresspersons are considered Transgender Male/Female if their gender identity and/or gender expression differs from the sex they were assigned at birth (definition retrieved from <a href="https://www.glaad.org/reference/transgender">GLAAD.</a>). The subset was intentionally separated from the other two cis genders to illustrate the lack of representation, but The Guardian does not necessarily support the notion of a gender difference between cis men and women and transgender men and women. </p>
            <p><b>3.</b> Congresspersons are considered LGB if they are lesbian, gay, or bisexual and have stated so publicly.</p>
            <p><b>4.</b> The ethnicity groups are defined by the <a href="https://www.census.gov/mso/www/training/pdf/race-ethnicity-onepager.pdf">United States Census Bureau's racial data guidelines</a>: white (including middle-eastern), black, asian, american indian, and two or more races. The US Census Bureau does not include Hispanic americas as a racial subgroup, but defines Hispanic origins as being from a country of Latin America. Because of the inclusion of Hispanic Americans, and the exclusion of other groups (other race and Pacific Islander), the total percentages for racial breakdown might not equal 100%.</p>
            <p><b>5.</b> Congresspersons are considered multiracial if they identify with two or more races. Definition and national data of this group is retrieved from the <a href="https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/briefs/c2010br-13.pdf">2010 Census Briefs</a>.</p>
            <p><b>6.</b> Our dataset did not include cross-categorization of ethnicity and race. All race categories ("white", "black", etc.) should be interpreted as non-hispanic.</p>
            <p><b>7.</b> The Church of Latter-Day Saints has <a href="https://www.lds.org/topics/christians?lang=eng">affirmed themselves</a> to be under the umbrella of Christianity; they were intentioanally excluded from the group to show prominence of representation.</p>
