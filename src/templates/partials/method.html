            <p><b>1.</b> Data collected are for the candidates confirmed in office. Candidates and races were confirmed using the AP Elections API. Demographic data was confirmed via a list of online sources listed below. </p>
            <p><b>*2.</b> Gender was divided into cis male, cis female, and trans + non binary in order to highlight the lack of congressional representation of those under the transgender identity. Congresspersons are considered Trans + non binary if their gender identity and/or gender expression differs from the sex they were assigned at birth (definition retrieved from <a href="https://www.glaad.org/reference/transgender">GLAAD.</a>).</p>
            <p><b>3.</b> Congresspersons are considered LGB if they are lesbian, gay, or bisexual and have stated so publicly.</p>
            <p><b>4.</b> The ethnicity groups are defined by the <a href="https://www.census.gov/mso/www/training/pdf/race-ethnicity-onepager.pdf">United States Census Bureau's racial data guidelines</a>: white, black, asian, american indian, and two or more races. The US Census Bureau does not include Hispanic americans or Middle Eastern americans as racial subgroups, so national data was retrieved from other sources. Because of the inclusion of Hispanic Americans, and the exclusion of other groups (other race and Pacific Islander), the total percentages for racial breakdown might not equal 100%.</p>
            <p><b>5.</b> Congresspersons are considered multiracial if they identify with two or more races. Definition and national data of this group is retrieved from the <a href="https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/briefs/c2010br-13.pdf">2010 Census Briefs</a>.</p>
            <p><b>6.</b> Our dataset did not include cross-categorization of ethnicity and race. All race categories ("white", "black", etc.) should be interpreted as non-hispanic.</p>
            <p><b>7.</b> The Church of Latter-Day Saints has <a href="https://www.lds.org/topics/christians?lang=eng">affirmed themselves</a> to be under the umbrella of Christianity; they were intentioanally excluded from the group to show prominence of representation.</p>
